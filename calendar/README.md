# Demo application

This is a demo application that showcases the plugin in action.

# Running the application

If you are coming here for the first time after cloning the repository make sure to build the plugin's code located in the `src` folder. To build it simply run the `npm run postclone` scripts in `src`. After that you can use the NativeScripty CLI commands like `tns run` as usual.
